# Branch Time Tracker

A VS Code extension that tracks time spent on different Git branches with a beautiful tab-based interface.

**Current Version**: 0.3.4

## Features

- Tracks time spent on each Git branch
- Displays statistics in a dedicated tab with visual percentage bars
- Dark/light theme support
- Saves time tracking data between sessions
- Simple and lightweight
- Visual time distribution across branches
- Manual refresh button for up-to-date statistics
- Auto-refresh with configurable interval (1-300 seconds)
- Improved error handling for git operations
- Enhanced UI with better visual hierarchy
- Persistent tab-based statistics view
- Real-time branch time tracking

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)
2. Open a Git repository in VS Code
3. The extension will automatically start tracking branch time

## Usage

- The extension automatically tracks time when you switch between branches
- Click the status bar item to open detailed statistics in a new tab
- The statistics tab shows:
  - Time spent per branch with visual percentage bars
  - Current active branch
  - Total time tracked across all branches
  - Number of branches being tracked
- Time is tracked in the background while you work

### Viewing Statistics

1. Click on the time display in the status bar (e.g., "2h 30m on branch")
2. A new tab will open with detailed statistics
3. The view updates automatically when you switch branches

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.60.0 or higher
- Git installed and configured in your system PATH

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `branchTimeTracker.updateInterval`: How often to update the branch time (in milliseconds)

## Build Process

This project includes a build system that organizes build artifacts in a `builds` directory and prevents file overwrites.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- VS Code Extension Manager (vsce)

### Building the Extension

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Compile TypeScript**

   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

   This compiles the TypeScript code to the `builds/out` directory.

3. **Package the Extension**

   ```bash
   npm run vscode:package
   ```

   This creates a VSIX file in the `builds` directory with a timestamp in the filename (e.g., `branch-time-tracker-v0.3.4-20250816-020040.vsix`).

### Build Organization

- All build artifacts are stored in the `builds` directory
- Each VSIX file includes a timestamp to prevent overwrites
- The `builds/out` directory contains compiled JavaScript files
- The `builds` directory is excluded from version control

### Organizing Existing Builds

To organize existing VSIX files into the builds directory:

```bash
./scripts/organize-builds.sh
```

This script:

- Moves all `.vsix` files from the root directory to the `builds` directory
- Appends a timestamp to each filename
- Preserves the version number in the filename

### Installing a Local Build

To install a local build in VS Code:

1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Select "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
3. Navigate to the `builds` directory and select the desired VSIX file
