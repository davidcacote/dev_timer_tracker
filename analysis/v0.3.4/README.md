# Branch Time Tracker v0.3.4 Analysis

A stability-focused release to solidify the 0.3.x line before larger 0.4.0 changes. The emphasis is correctness, predictable autoâ€‘refresh behavior, and low overhead while the status bar and webview are open.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Make autoâ€‘refresh reliable and predictable in both status bar and webview
- Ensure live updates while webview is visible (no manual refresh needed)
- Reduce UI flicker and unnecessary updates
- Harden data handling (validation, backups) and timer lifecycle
- Small refactors to simplify core responsibilities

## ðŸ“Œ Scope (0.3.4)

- Autoâ€‘refresh logic rework (status bar + webview)
- Webview live sync and visibility handling
- Status bar debouncing and lightweight updates
- Data validation + safe-write and backup on corruption
- Timer lifecycle: pause when workspace inactive; resume cleanly
- Minor refactors: split large functions and centralize constants

## ðŸ”— Documents

- [Roadmap 0.3.4](./VERSION_0.3.4_ROADMAP.md)

## ðŸ§­ Context

- Current: 0.3.3 (stable)
- 0.4.0 branch has many new implementations; we will defer them to focus on stability here.

## âœ… Success Criteria

- Webview shows continuously increasing time while open (within configured interval)
- Status bar updates without flicker and matches webview values
- No timer or callback leaks after opening/closing the webview
- No unwanted time accrual when paused or when no workspace is active
- Data file remains valid; corrupted files are handled safely
