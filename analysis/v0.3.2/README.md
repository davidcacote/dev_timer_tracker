| Code Organization | 6/10          | 8/10         | Low      |
| Test Coverage     | 1/10          | 7/10         | Medium   |

## 🎯 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Days 1-3)

- [ ] Fix memory leak in refreshCallbacks
- [ ] Implement active branch change detection
- [ ] Add race condition protection
- [ ] Optimize timer management

### Phase 2: User Experience (Days 4-7)

- [ ] Add branch change notifications
- [ ] Implement pause/resume functionality
- [ ] Enhance error handling with user feedback
- [ ] Add loading states to status bar

### Phase 3: Quality & Testing (Days 8-10)

- [ ] Add data validation
- [ ] Implement unit tests
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Update documentation

## 📈 Performance Targets

### Current vs Target Performance:

- **Memory Usage**: 5-10MB (growing) → <5MB (stable)
- **Response Time**: 100-500ms → <100ms
- **Git Operations**: 1-2 calls/min → 1 call per branch change + cache
- **File I/O**: 1 write/min → Batched writes every 5 minutes

## 🔧 Key Technical Recommendations

1. **Fix Memory Leak**: Implement `CallbackManager` class with proper disposal
2. **Add Branch Detection**: File system watcher for `.git/HEAD` changes
3. **Race Condition Protection**: Mutex-like protection for async operations
4. **Performance Optimization**: Only run timer when workspace is active

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Review all analysis documents** to understand the full scope
2. **Prioritize critical fixes** for immediate implementation
3. **Create development tasks** based on the roadmap
4. **Set up testing infrastructure** for quality assurance
5. **Plan release strategy** for v0.3.3
