# Requirements Document - Branch Time Tracker v0.4.0

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for Branch Time Tracker version 0.4.0, a VS Code extension that tracks time spent on different Git branches. This version focuses on enhancing data management capabilities, improving user experience, and establishing a solid technical foundation for future features. The extension currently provides basic time tracking with a tab-based statistics view, and v0.4.0 will expand these capabilities with advanced export/import functionality, customizable presets, enhanced analytics, and project-specific configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Data Export/Import System

**User Story:** As a developer who works across multiple machines or needs to analyze time data externally, I want to export and import my branch time data in multiple formats, so that I can maintain continuity and perform advanced analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects the export command THEN the system SHALL provide format options including CSV and JSON
2. WHEN a user exports to CSV format THEN the system SHALL include columns for branch name, total time, last updated, and percentage of total time
3. WHEN a user exports to JSON format THEN the system SHALL include complete data structure with metadata and settings
4. WHEN a user imports data THEN the system SHALL validate the data format and show a confirmation dialog before replacing existing data
5. IF imported data is invalid THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and preserve existing data
6. WHEN export/import operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with file location

### Requirement 2: Customizable Time Tracking Presets

**User Story:** As a developer who works on different types of projects with varying tracking needs, I want to create and manage custom tracking presets, so that I can quickly apply appropriate settings for different workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new preset THEN the system SHALL allow naming the preset and configuring tracking parameters
2. WHEN a user applies a preset THEN the system SHALL update tracking settings including update intervals and display preferences
3. WHEN a user manages presets THEN the system SHALL provide options to create, edit, delete, and duplicate presets
4. IF a user deletes a preset THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog before removal
5. WHEN presets are modified THEN the system SHALL save changes persistently across VS Code sessions

### Requirement 3: Advanced Statistics and Filtering

**User Story:** As a developer who wants deeper insights into my time allocation, I want advanced filtering and analytics in the statistics view, so that I can better understand my development patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the statistics view THEN the system SHALL display filtering options for date ranges, branch patterns, and time thresholds
2. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL update the display to show only matching branches and recalculate percentages
3. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL show additional metrics including average session time, most active periods, and branch switching frequency
4. WHEN a user searches for branches THEN the system SHALL provide real-time filtering based on branch name patterns
5. IF no branches match the current filters THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message and suggest filter adjustments

### Requirement 4: Project-Specific Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer who works on multiple projects with different tracking requirements, I want project-specific configurations, so that each workspace can have tailored tracking settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a workspace THEN the system SHALL check for project-specific configuration and apply it if available
2. WHEN a user modifies settings in a workspace THEN the system SHALL provide options to save as project-specific or global settings
3. WHEN project-specific settings exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize them over global settings
4. IF a workspace has no specific configuration THEN the system SHALL use global settings as defaults
5. WHEN switching between workspaces THEN the system SHALL automatically apply the appropriate configuration for each workspace

### Requirement 5: Improved Core Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want reliable and performant time tracking, so that the extension doesn't impact my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL initialize within 2 seconds and consume less than 50MB of memory
2. WHEN tracking time over extended periods THEN the system SHALL maintain memory usage below 100MB
3. WHEN performing git operations THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback
4. IF git operations fail THEN the system SHALL continue functioning with cached data and retry operations automatically
5. WHEN the extension is active THEN the system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime for time tracking functionality

### Requirement 6: Enhanced User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension daily, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can quickly access information and perform actions without interrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with the statistics view THEN the system SHALL respond to actions within 500ms
2. WHEN displaying time data THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting and clear visual hierarchy
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly messages with actionable suggestions
4. IF the system is performing background operations THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
5. WHEN the interface updates THEN the system SHALL maintain user context and scroll position where appropriate

### Requirement 7: Data Integrity and Backup

**User Story:** As a developer who relies on accurate time tracking data, I want automatic data protection and integrity checks, so that I never lose my tracking history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving time data THEN the system SHALL create automatic backups of the previous state
2. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery from backup and notify the user
3. WHEN performing data operations THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity before and after operations
4. IF data validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent data loss and provide recovery options
5. WHEN the extension shuts down THEN the system SHALL ensure all pending data is saved before termination
