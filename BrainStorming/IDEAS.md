# BrainStorming - Branch Time Tracker

This document is for recording ideas, discussions, and improvement proposals for Branch Time Tracker.

## Initial Topics

### 1. Separation of Timers by Project

- Allow users to view and manage the time spent on each project/repository separately.
- Useful for those who work on multiple projects simultaneously.

### 2. Aggregation of Timers by IDE

- Enable viewing the total time spent across all branches of all projects open in the IDE.
- Makes it easier to track total IDE usage time, regardless of project.

### 3. Better Organization of Tracking Data

- Explore ways to present tracking data more clearly and intuitively.
- Suggestions for visualization, filters, export, etc.
